# Cozy Homes
Fabric Furniture Minecraft Mod, 1.20.5+

## Information
>**Public Announcement**
>Hey! This is a personal project to practice my Java. I've seen a lack of furniture mods lately so I decided that me and my cousin, italysister_404, will make one of our own. This is just a fun project, there will be many bugs and issues as I am not very experienced myself. There are a TON of things that I plan for this but the update times will be horrid because I have other things going on in my life, I'm only a high-school student after all.

>This will hopefully be very fun though!
